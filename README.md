Recipe App (Android)
This is a sample Android application demonstrating modern Android development practices, including Jetpack Compose for UI, Hilt for dependency injection, Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations, and a clean MVVM architecture. The app allows users to view a list of recipes and delete them.

‚ú® Features
Recipe List Display: Shows a list of pre-defined (fake) recipes.

Delete Recipe: Allows users to delete recipes from the list.

Input Validation (Backend Logic): Includes a use case for validating recipe input, though not directly exposed in the current UI.

Dependency Injection: Uses Hilt for managing dependencies throughout the app.

Reactive UI: Utilizes Kotlin Flow and Jetpack Compose's collectAsStateWithLifecycle for reactive UI updates.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Kotlin: A modern programming language for Android development.

Jetpack Compose: Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.

Hilt: A dependency injection library for Android that provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger into your Android app.

Kotlin Coroutines & Flow: For asynchronous programming and reactive data streams.

Android Architecture Components:

ViewModel: Stores and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware way.

Lifecycle: Manages the lifecycle of UI components.

Navigation Compose: For navigating between composable screens.

Room (configured): For local database persistence (though not actively used in the provided snippet, it's set up).

DataStore (configured): For storing key-value pairs or typed objects (though not actively used in the provided snippet, it's set up).

WorkManager (configured): For deferrable background tasks (though not actively used in the provided snippet, it's set up).

Retrofit & Gson (configured): For networking and JSON parsing.

Apollo GraphQL (configured): For GraphQL API interactions.

Unit Testing: JUnit, Mockito, MockK, Coroutines Test.

üìê Architecture
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, enhanced with a Use Case (Interactor) layer and Dependency Injection (Hilt):

View (Composables): RecipeScreen, RecipeItem - Responsible for rendering the UI and observing ViewModel state.

ViewModel: RecipeViewModel - Exposes StateFlows for UI state, handles UI logic, and interacts with Use Cases.

Use Cases (Domain Layer): GetRecipesUseCase, DeleteRecipeUseCase, ValidateRecipeInputUseCase - Encapsulate specific business logic operations. They orchestrate data from repositories.

Repository: RecipeRepository (interface) and RecipeRepositoryImpl (implementation) - Abstracts data sources (e.g., network, database, local fake data).

Dependency Injection (Hilt): RecipeModule - Manages the creation and provision of dependencies.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Run
Prerequisites:

Android Studio (Bumblebee or newer recommended)

JDK 11 or higher

Git

Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with your actual repository URL
cd recipe-app

Open in Android Studio:

Open Android Studio.

Select File > Open and navigate to the cloned recipe-app directory.

Sync Gradle:

Android Studio will automatically prompt you to sync the Gradle project. If not, click File > Sync Project with Gradle Files.

Run the Application:

Select an Android Emulator or a connected physical device.

Click the Run button (green triangle) in the toolbar.

The app should launch, displaying the list of fake recipes. You can tap the delete icon next to each recipe to remove it from the list.

üìÅ Code Structure (Key Files)
data/Recipe.kt: Data class for a recipe.

data/RecipeRepository.kt: Interface for data operations.

data/RecipeRepositoryImpl.kt: Fake implementation of the repository.

domain/usecase/: Contains the use case classes (GetRecipesUseCase, DeleteRecipeUseCase, ValidateRecipeInputUseCase).

di/RecipeModule.kt: Hilt module for providing repository and use case dependencies.

presentation/viewmodel/RecipeViewModel.kt: ViewModel managing the UI state and interacting with use cases.

presentation/ui/BundleRecipeActivity.kt: The main Activity that hosts the Compose UI.

presentation/ui/RecipeScreen.kt: The main Composable screen for displaying recipes.

presentation/ui/RecipeItem.kt: A Composable for displaying a single recipe item.

ComposeNavigationApp.kt: The Hilt application class (@HiltAndroidApp).

üí° Future Enhancements
Add Recipe Functionality: Implement a screen to add new recipes.

Edit Recipe Functionality: Allow users to edit existing recipes.

Persistence: Integrate the Room database to persist recipes locally.

Network Integration: Fetch recipes from a real API using Retrofit.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and display appropriate messages to the user.

Loading States: Show loading indicators while fetching data.

Testing: Expand unit and UI tests for all layers of the application.

Search/Filter: Add functionality to search or filter recipes.
